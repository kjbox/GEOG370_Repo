<h1>Homework 6 Part 2: Census data ratios & classifications </h1>

<h3><b>Equal Interval Choropleth</b></h3>

    </a>
<p><b>Pros: </b>Equal interval choropleths are easily able to be interpreted by the everyday person. Because all of the intervals are equal in range, it is easy to tell where certain places fall in comparison to others when considering a specific measure.</p>
<p><b>Cons: </b>Outliers can easily throw off an equal interval classification. If there is a high outlier, most entries could be placed in the lower one or two intervals, making the map hard to interpret. An interval could also be skipped altogether, with no entries residing in it. This doesn't seem to be the case with this data though.</p>

<h3><b>Equal Count Choropleth</b></h3>

    </a>
<p><b>Pros: </b>Equal count choropleths make it easy to compare varying areas to the median point of the data.</p>
<p><b>Cons: </b>It's hard to know the numerical differences between categories because this classification just aims to make sure each color is represented equally on the map.</p>
