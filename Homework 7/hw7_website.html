    <h3>Description: </h3>
    <p>This map shows the rate of tourist arrivals in Central America in 2019. I chose this topic because my boyfriend's family is Nicaraguan and we've been planning a trip to Nicaragua for a while. He traveled a lot growing up, and some of his family members have recently relocated to various Central American countries. I wanted to look at the tourism rate in these places to gauge where I should plan on traveling if I want to visit or avoid popular tourist locations. 2019 was the most recent year that I found data for, and I used an equal count model for the legend on this map because Mexico is such a large tourist destination that it threw off the coloration of the equal interval map and I am just interested in the general themes of tourism in the area.</p>
